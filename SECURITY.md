## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security very seriously. If you discover a potential security vulnerability or issue in our project, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose publicly**: To protect users, please refrain from publishing security findings or vulnerabilities publicly. Public disclosures can increase risks for users if vulnerabilities are exploited before they are resolved.

2. **Contact us directly**: Report any potential security issues to our dedicated security email: [TheKhanSoft (at) gmail dot com]().

3. **Provide detailed information**: When reporting a vulnerability, please include:
   - A description of the issue.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - Any potential impact or risk assessment.
   - Suggestions for mitigation, if possible.

We appreciate your responsible disclosure and will work promptly to investigate and resolve any reported issues.
